Matrix Rain Speeddial
===================
Adds the famous animated matrix rain effect to the speeddial background. This mod will cause some additional minor CPU load when viewing the speeddial (when not viewing the speeddial it is inactive).
The rain effect applies a transparent mixing mode to the current speeddial background. Use a pure black background for the speeddial if you want to see rain only. 

You can experiment with the `mix-blend-mode`value in the `style.css` for interesting mixing modes with your current speeddial background:
